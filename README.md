# Protein-Database
A normalized relational database (3NF) for the RCSB PDB Human Macromolecular Structure Dataset, optimized for bioinformatics and ML/DL applications.

Protein-Structure-Database-Project
Project Description: RCSB PDB Human Macromolecular Structure Database This project involves the creation and normalization of a relational database for the RCSB PDB Human Macromolecular Structure Dataset. The dataset includes 11,832 protein structures obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB), covering X-ray crystallography-determined structures of Homo sapiens (human) proteins from 2015 to 2023.

Key Features: Includes structural features such as: Number of residues, chains, and secondary structure components (helix, sheet, coil). Data filtered for X-ray diffraction with resolutions ranging from 1.0 Å to 3.0 Å for high-quality results. Optimized for tasks like: Protein-ligand binding prediction. Enzyme classification. Secondary structure and structural motif detection. Protein stability and domain analysis. Database Normalization: The dataset has been structured in Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure:

Reduced data redundancy. Improved data integrity and consistency. Enhanced performance for data querying and analysis. Applications: This normalized database provides a robust framework for downstream machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) tasks, enabling efficient data extraction and analysis for various bioinformatics and computational biology applications.

Repository Content: SQL scripts for database creation and 3NF normalization. Documentation on dataset features and their extraction process. Use cases and examples for querying the database in bioinformatics contexts.
